<h1>Dicechess Arena</h1>
<div id="instructions">
	<p>In this two-player game, <strong>the goal is to capture all of your opponent's pieces</strong>. Like in chess, the way you capture a piece is by moving your own piece onto its square. But unlike in chess, the way these pieces move is determined by <em>a roll of the dice</em>.</p>
	<p>We have special six-sided dice with a different possible move on each face. At the start of your turn, you roll three of these dice. For each of these dice, you can choose to move any one of your pieces. First click on the die you wish to use, then click on the piece you wish to move, then the destination square. You can use these dice in any order, and you are not required to use all of them before you finish your turn.</p>
	<p>The six possible moves are:

	<p>This game was created for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, whose theme is "Roll of the Dice." The other main inspiration for this game is of course chess and in particular chess variants, in which people have invented all kinds of new rules, pieces, and restrictions on top of regular chess. If you found my game fun or at least interesting, you may want to search for other chess variants; there's a long tradition of them, some more closely resembling chess than others. All six moves in this game have established names in chess variants (ferz, alfil, wazir, dabbaaba, narrow knight, and wide knight).</p>
	<p>Rook, bishop, and knight icons are by Skoll and are taken from <a href="https://www.game-icons.net">game-icons.net</a> under the CC BY license. Player pieces and modifications to the chess icons are by Viola Buddy.</p>
